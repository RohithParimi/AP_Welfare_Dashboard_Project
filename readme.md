# Andhra Pradesh Welfare Schemes Data Analysis and Reporting Dashboard

## 1. Overall Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to gain a clearer understanding of the expenditure on key welfare schemes in Andhra Pradesh and analyze their potential correlation with various socio-economic indicators within the state. This analysis aims to provide insights into the financial implications and observed impacts of these "freebies" or welfare initiatives, fostering an informed perspective on the state's development.

## 2. Scope (Phase 1 of AI/ML Master Journey)

This project constitutes Phase 1 of a broader AI/ML Master Journey. It focuses on foundational data science skills:

- Data Acquisition
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization
- Interactive Dashboard Creation

## 3. Key Data Sources Identified

- Andhra Pradesh Finance Department Website (apfinance.gov.in):
  - Budget Documents: "Annual Financial Statement & Explanatory Memorandum on Budget" (Vol-I/1) and "Statement of Demands for Grants" (Vol-I/2).
- Andhra Pradesh State Development Planning Society (APSDPS) Website (apsdps.ap.gov.in):
  - Socio-Economic Surveys.
- PRS India (prsindia.org):
  - Budget analyses and summaries (for cross-referencing and additional context).
- Other official reports (e.g., NITI Aayog, PIB releases): For specific statistics like employment rates if not comprehensively found in primary sources.

## 4. Key Data Types to Gather

- Welfare Scheme Expenditure Data:
  - Expenditure figures (Actuals, Revised Estimates, Budget Estimates).
  - Focus on 3-4 key welfare schemes identified (e.g., YSR Pension Kanuka, YSR Amma Vodi/Thalliki Vandanam, YSR Rythu Bharosa, YSR Cheyutha).
  - Total welfare spending by the state.
- State-Level Socio-Economic Indicators:
  - Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP)
  - Per Capita Income (PCI)
  - Literacy Rate
  - Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) (Primary, Secondary, Higher Education)
  - School Dropout Rates
  - Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)
  - Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)
  - Total Fertility Rate (TFR)
  - Life Expectancy at Birth
  - Unemployment Rate
  - Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR)
  - Financial Inclusion (e.g., households with bank accounts, if data is granular enough)

## 5. Expected Outputs

- Cleaned and transformed CSV/Excel datasets.
- A well-documented Jupyter Notebook showcasing data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA/visualizations.
- An interactive PowerBI (or advanced Excel) dashboard.
- A concise executive summary of key project findings.

## 6. Personal Connection

This project holds significant personal importance as I am from Andhra Pradesh and deeply resonate with the state's growth and development. This connection motivates me to derive clear and actionable insights from the data, which will also refine my analytical thinking and perspective.
